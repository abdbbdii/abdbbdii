I spend too much time feeling sad over anime characters, getting mad at games I totally know how to play (blame lag, not me), bricking Android devices just to bring them back like some kind of tech wizard, fighting with Adobe while pretending Iâ€™m a designer, and writing code that only works when it wants to. Basically, my life is just chaos, and Iâ€™m fine with that. ðŸ¥²
